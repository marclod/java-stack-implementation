# Stack Project in Java

## Description  
📚 **This project** is a **basic implementation of a data structure of the type Stack** in Java, using **interfaces and generics**. The aim is to demonstrate how to create a stack based on a **dynamic array**, providing essential operations. This project was developed to **assist in learning how sequential data structures work** in Java.

## Features  
- **🔼 `push(T element):`** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **⬇️ `pop():`** Removes and returns the element at the top of the stack.
- **👀 `peek():`** Returns the element at the top without removing it.
- **❓ `isEmpty():`** Checks if the stack is empty.
- **📏 `size():`** Returns the number of elements present in the stack.
